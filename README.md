Each Teachable Plan provides you with unique features and opportunities for expanding your online course-selling experience.

So, let’s learn more about Teachable plans in-depth, comparing all features and highlighting which plan is most suited to your requirements:

### Basic Plan

Teachable’s basic package is [**$29 per month**](https://bit.ly/3OMtoJx) when invoiced annually, and it is the cheapest option, whether you want to build your own LMS system or enroll in any course or video to learn.

Not only this, but It also gives you unrestricted access to learning everything (students, courses, video, and hosting).

This is one of the things that makes Teachable so interesting.

Detail about all Features offered under the Teachable Basic plan:

Thus, in my opinion, this plan is a suitable fit for any user who just wants to begin or experiment with the strength and capabilities of Teachable as a platform for learning courses as a student or creating your school with its feature-rich option that aids in the same.

However, this plan is not advised if you want to expand your business or provide coaching because the price for each transaction is 5%.

This, in the case of many students being enrolled, will lower your profit, and the ability to obtain course completion certification, as well as the inability to advertise your class through affiliate marketing, will have a significant influence.

**In conclusion,** the Teachable Basic Plan is only appropriate for students or teachers who wish to discover how teachable works and then choose the Pro Plan or Business Plan to expand and get all benefits.
